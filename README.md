# Back In Stock

The Back In Stock module empowers customers to stay informed about product availability while enabling merchants to retain potential sales for out-of-stock items. This module allows customers to subscribe to real-time notifications when products are restocked, improving customer satisfaction and reducing abandoned purchases. Merchants gain visibility into customer demand through a centralized back office interface, helping inform inventory planning.

## Key features

* **Native Integration with Virto Commerce Frontend.**
* **"Notify Me When In Stock" Button.** Automatically displays a subscription button on product detail pages when inventory reaches zero. Customers can opt into notifications without leaving the page.
* **Self-Service Subscription Management.** Authenticated customers can view and manage their active subscriptions in a dedicated "Back In Stock" list. They can remove subscriptions for products they no longer wish to track.
* **Real-Time Email Notifications.** Triggers email notifications immediately when product inventory is updated from zero to a positive value. Notifications include product details and direct links to the product page.
* **Automatic Subscription Cleanup.**
* **Back Office Subscription Management.**
* **Ready for Export & Analysis.**

## Configurations
1. Open Stores, select store, and open Settings.
